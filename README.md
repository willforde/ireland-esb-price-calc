A simple price calculator for Ireland's electricity providers.

Unlike the standard price comparison sites that use the EAB(estimated annual bill). This
calculator takes your actual usage and calculates the price for each electric provider.
It will show the price for the first year with the new customer discount and then 
the price for the second year with the standard discount.
